Please upload the notebook to google colab, 
so that you don't have to install these requirements.
We have used a seed of 50 for reproducibility.

We have recieved an F1, Precision and Recall of 
1 across all the 4 folds.

Here are the requirements:
--------------------------
numpy == for matrix computations
matplotlib == for visualization
scikit-learn == for metrics
imblearn == for oversampling
tqdm == for visualizing the progress
--------------------------

Momentum, oversampling, bias, solution using 5 
neurons is implemented. 
Please use CS772_Assingment1_5neurons.ipynb
to get the solution.

The history folder has all the dumps that 
were required for the models.
You can change the path and load the saved model.
