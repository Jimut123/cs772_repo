the user messages are messages that the user wrote

the assistant messages those the bot wrote

the system message is a message that the developer wrote to tell the bot how to interpret the conversation. They're 
supposed to give instructions that can override the rest of the convo, but they're not always super reliable 
depending on what model you're using.
